## Why CodeCafé?

We saw coding classes juggling tools built for essays, not engineers. Existing solutions felt clunky for the dynamic nature of real-time programming. CodeCafé was born from the need for a seamless, browser-based coding space designed from the ground up for _true_ collaboration. Learn, teach, and build—together, instantly.

## Core Features

- **Pixel-Perfect Live Preview:** See your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript changes render _instantly_ in an integrated Web View. What you code is what you see!
- **True Real-Time Collaboration:** Powered by Operational Transformation, multiple users can type in the same files simultaneously, with conflicts resolved seamlessly.
- **VS Code Feel:** Enjoy a familiar, rich editing experience (via Monaco Editor) with syntax highlighting, smart suggestions, and error checking.
- **Zero Setup:** Dive straight into coding. Everything runs in the browser.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Monaco Editor, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot
- **Real-time Collaboration:** WebSocket + Operational Transformation (OT)
